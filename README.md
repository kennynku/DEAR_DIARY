## Introduction
Dear Diary is a blog page which was inspired by how frantic we get due to our interlocking schedules in our daily lives. It is designed to help us not let anything fall in between the cracks by being able to create daily entries where we can easily schedule our time for each day or even schedule diaries for the future. Or better yet, create diaries to just pour our innermost thoughts which we do not wish to share with other people.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started OR Installation

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```
## Access the app
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
