## Introduction
Blogger's hub is a blog post page which was inspired by bloggers around the world. My partner and I have observed that people have so much to talk about so why not give them a platform to talk, primarily educate each other on topics of interest with respect and integrity. It is a platform where knowledge is accessible in seconds and anyone is free to engage with anyone on a topic of interest and learn a thing or two. We dont only get educated through school so why not informalize getting educated through a blog and make it actually fun to learn.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started OR Installation

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```
## Access the app
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
